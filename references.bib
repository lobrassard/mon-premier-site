I know it comes off a bit unrelated, yes, but in that time I've found myself binging on anime and manga and looking to Japan for entertainment. Somehow in the last few weeks both Big Eyes Small Mouth (BESM) 4e, an anime-inspired TTRPG made in North America, and Shinobigami, a popular TRPG from Japan recently translated for English-speaking audiences, came out in quick succession. It got me thinking as to what the tabletop communities in Japan were},

This study evaluated potential differences in character identification and interaction in a gaming context affording various character materialities: the role-playing game Dungeons \& Dragons. Multimethod analysis of online survey data (N = 1,135) reveals that character identification and interaction dimensions were invariant across primary character-representation mode (figurine, physical image, digital image, written, and imagined); however, post-hoc analysis suggests that multimaterial assemblages and social factors are key in how character representations are linked to character relations. Following, we argue that game characters may be more appropriately understood as subjective experiences rather than varying according to a given digital or physical manifestation.},

The players who participated in this scenario afterward answered an open-ended survey. On the one hand, the survey results point to limitations of the current version of the scenario but also implied essential factors for developing and managing CoC TRPG scenarios and sessions for peace educational purposes. First, for effective sessions, the scenario needs to incorporate the main theme intelligibly for players. Second, letting players think about how their characters perceive social issues may help players rethink their views and contribute to raising awareness of an issue. Third, sessions benefit from adapting them to different formats of play: offline and remote play, voice chat, and text chat sessions.},

	url = {http://www.ijrp.subcultures.nl/wp-content/issue4/IJRPissue4jara.pdf},
	abstract = {As texts which are based on collaborative and interactive narration, tabletop – also
known as “pen and paper” – role-playing games (TRPGs) are distinct in their technological simplicity.
Indeed, in their traditional form all they require is the physical presence of a group of players – commonly
around a table, hence “tabletop” – who collaboratively participate in developing a narrative; and a system
of rules which allow resolving the outcome of situations in which different levels of chance may be
involved – the need to write down statistic information making them “pen and paper”. Evidently, this
apparent lack of sophistication makes role-playing games – as a clearly contemporary cultural
phenomenon (cf. Punday, 2005; Nephew, 2004; Harrigan, 2007; Mackay, 2001) – stand out in the context of
a world that is becoming ever more dependent on technology. All the more so, considering the persistence
of TRPGs in the face of its “descendants” in other more technologically advanced media and despite what
has become the popular notion of “the bigger, the faster, the better.” Nevertheless, that which occurs
during a role-playing game session – the level of interactivity, player immersion in the narrative, flexibility
of the rules, etc. - generally surpasses, even today, what many of its “successors” achieve. How does this
occur? How is it possible; through what mechanisms do TRPGs allow such sophistication when relying
solely on the “old fashioned” technologies of (hand-) writing and oral narration? Approaching these
questions from the general perspective of literary studies, the following paper problematizes what can be
called a “naïve view” of communication technology by addressing the complex relationship between the
printed texts used for role-playing – such as rule- and sourcebooks – and the narratives created during
game-play. To do so, it addresses the fundamental influence that framings, such as rules, character sheets
and setting, as well as paratextual elements contained within or at the borders of these texts, such as cover
illustrations, prologues and epilogues, just to name a few – have on participants’ interpretation and, most
importantly, creation of TRPG narratives.},

The primary research method will be participant observations of these speech events over at least 100 hours of game play. Game sessions will be recorded in audio and video format so as to capture the full range of verbal and non-verbal artistry that accompanies role-playing generally. These recordings will be selectively transcribed. A web site will be constructed which will facilitate IRB and thesis committee monitoring as well as disseminate all findings. Guiding theory is arranged into the domains of Performance, Bricolage, Double-Voiced Discourse and Idioculture. I intend to challenge the idea that tabletop role-play involves a degenerative, limited type of performance. I want to explore the ways in which game participants use double-voiced discourse and strategies of persuasion during game events. I want to examine game structures such as adventures and character speech acts as if they were bricolage; are there patterns in the types of creative collages I will encounter? Considering the amount of context specific frames that role-players use and create during their games (Idioculture), my 18-year familiarity with role-playing games is an asset. This thesis project will not only extend an anthropological foothold into a relatively unexplored type of speech event, it will also significantly improve the existing body of theory which describes and explains role-playing games generally. Research will conclude with a public thesis defense in Fall 2005.},
